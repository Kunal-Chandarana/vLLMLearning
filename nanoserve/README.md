# nanoserve

A small LLM inference engine, built step by step to learn how vLLM works
inside. Each step is checked against the Hugging Face reference
implementation.

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Qwen2 written from scratch (GQA, RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm), loading HF safetensors | ✅ |
| 2 | Paged KV cache: fixed-size blocks, block allocator, per-sequence block tables | |
| 3 | Continuous-batching scheduler: mixed prefill + decode, preemption when blocks run out | |
| 4 | OpenAI-compatible streaming server, measured with [`benchmarks/`](../benchmarks/README.md) | |
| 5 | Head-to-head with `vllm serve` on the same GPU, with a write-up of the gap | |

## Design

- **Flat token batches.** The model takes `input_ids` and `positions` of shape
  `[num_tokens]`, not padded `[batch, seq_len]`. One forward pass can then mix
  prompt tokens from new requests with single decode tokens from running ones,
  which is what continuous batching needs.
- **Stateless model, pluggable attention.** The KV cache lives in an attention
  backend passed into `forward`. Step 1 uses `ContiguousKVCache` (one sequence,
  `max_len` slots reserved up front). Step 2 swaps in a paged backend without
  touching the model.
- **Logits only where needed.** `compute_logits` runs the LM head on just the
  rows being sampled. For a 1,000-token prompt that skips a `[1000, 151936]`
  matmul.
- **RoPE tables stay float32** when weights are cast to bf16/fp16, because
  low-precision cos/sin drift at long positions.

## Usage

```bash
pip install torch transformers safetensors huggingface_hub
python -m nanoserve.generate --chat --prompt "What is a KV cache?" --max-tokens 128
python -m nanoserve.generate --device mps --dtype float16   # Apple GPU
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_nanoserve_model.py                          # tiny random model, no download
NANOSERVE_REAL_MODEL=1 pytest tests/test_nanoserve_model.py   # + Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (~1 GB)
```

The tests check prefill logits, prefill followed by token-by-token decode, and
greedy generation against `transformers`. For the real model, the full-sequence
logits match exactly in float32.

Two traps in comparing against `transformers.generate`:
- **Pass an `attention_mask`.** Qwen's pad token is its EOS token, so
  `transformers` can't infer the mask.
- **Set `repetition_penalty=1.0`.** The checkpoint's `generation_config.json`
  sets it to 1.1, which applies even under greedy decoding.
